This project involves web scraping using the Beautiful Soup library to extract data from an Amazon web page. It is important to note that web scraping can be a violation of website terms of service and can potentially lead to legal issues. To avoid issues, it is recommended to obtain explicit permission from the website before proceeding with any scraping activities. Additionally, some websites may block scraping of dynamic data, but using headers can help bypass these limitations. Made a CSV for that....
